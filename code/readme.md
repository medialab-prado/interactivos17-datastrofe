# Datástrofe
### Developed with Unity 5 (c#)

## Controls:
Videogame is designed to be controlled with a original xbox360 gamepad, using left joystick to control mouse through applications like Enjoy2 (open source) or Joystick Mapper. Right stick is for moving map; other controls (action buttons, zoom or rotate map) can be configured in input mapper.

## About builds:
- MacOS (arquitechture independant) may have a bug with shaders, freezing and crashing compilation randomly. 
- PC build seems to run without problems.

For any doubt regarding compilation or code dont heasitate to contact [tonijota](http://twitter.com/tonijota) or [lucía](http://luciaseguramente.com)

Feel free to fork.

### Happy coding!
